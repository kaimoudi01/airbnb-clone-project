- **Framework**: FastAPI or Flask  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / SQLite  
- **Frontend**: (Optional) HTML/CSS/JS  
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub  
- **Deployment**: Render / Railway / Docker

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the backend:

```bash

- Ensures data integrity, security, and backups.
- Optimizes queries for performance.

### 🎨 Frontend Developer
- Creates the user interface and user experience of the platform.
- Connects the UI with the backend via API calls.
- Ensures responsive and accessible design.

### 🧪 QA Engineer (Quality Assurance)
- Writes test cases and performs manual/automated testing.
- Identifies bugs and ensures feature correctness before release.
- Validates usability and performance under different conditions.

### 🛠️ DevOps Engineer
- Sets up CI/CD pipelines, servers, and deployment environments.
- Monitors infrastructure, handles scalability and updates.
- Automates routine operations to ensure high availability.

### 📋 Project Manager
- Coordinates team tasks and timelines.
- Communicates project goals and tracks progress.
- Ensures the team delivers value on time and within scope.

### 🤖 AI/ML Engineer (Optional Role)
- Designs and integrates smart features like recommendation systems or chatbots.
- Trains, tests, and deploys machine learning models.
- Works closely with backend developers to integrate AI into the platform.
## 🛠 Technology Stack

Below is the list of technologies used in this project and their purposes:

| Technology       | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **FastAPI**      | A high-performance Python web framework for building RESTful APIs.      |
| **Python**       | Core programming language used for backend logic and scripting.         |
| **SQLModel**     | ORM (Object Relational Mapper) to interact with the database using Python classes. |
| **PostgreSQL**   | Relational database used to store user data, listings, and bookings.    |
| **Uvicorn**      | ASGI server to run the FastAPI application with high performance.       |
| **Docker**       | Containerization tool to standardize development and deployment.        |
| **Git & GitHub** | Version control and collaboration for managing the project codebase.    |
| **OpenAI API** *(optional)* | Used for AI-based features like generating text or smart recommendations. |
## 🧩 Feature Breakdown

Below is a breakdown of the core features of the AirBnB Clone project:

### 👤 User Management
Allows users to register, log in, update their profiles, and manage their personal data. This feature includes authentication and authorization to ensure secure access to the platform.

### 🏘️ Property Management
Hosts can add, update, or delete property listings. This feature enables users to provide details such as location, images, pricing, availability, and descriptions for each property.

### 📆 Booking System
Guests can browse available properties and make bookings based on dates and availability. This feature handles reservation creation, status updates, and prevents double-booking.

### 💬 Reviews & Ratings *(optional for later stage)*
Users can leave feedback and ratings for properties they’ve booked. This helps improve trust and transparency on the platform.
## 🔐 API Security

Security is a critical part of the AirBnB Clone project, especially when dealing with user data, authentication, and transactions. Below are the main API security measures that will be implemented:

### 🔑 Authentication
We will use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate users after login. JWTs ensure that only verified users can access protected endpoints. This helps prevent unauthorized access and impersonation.

### 🔐 Authorization
Only certain actions (like editing listings or viewing user bookings) will be available to logged-in users with the correct roles (e.g., host, guest). Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that users can only perform actions they're allowed to.

### 🚫 Rate Limiting *(planned)*
To prevent abuse (e.g., brute-force attacks), rate limiting will be used to restrict how many requests a client can make in a short period. This keeps the system fair and stable under high traffic.

### 🔒 Data Protection
Sensitive information such as passwords will be hashed using industry-standard hashing algorithms like bcrypt. This ensures that even if the database is compromised, user passwords remain safe.

### 📄 Input Validation & Error Handling
All inputs from users (e.g., form submissions, API payloads) will be validated using Pydantic models to prevent malicious input and injection attacks.

> Security is not a one-time feature — it’s an ongoing commitment to protect users, data, and the platform itself.
## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code changes. This ensures that new features and fixes are delivered quickly and reliably without manual intervention.

For this project, setting up a CI/CD pipeline will help:

- Automatically run tests on each commit or pull request to maintain code quality.
- Build and containerize the application using Docker for consistent environments.
- Deploy the application to cloud platforms like Render or Railway seamlessly.

### Tools

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows like testing and deployment triggered by GitHub events.
- **Docker**: Creates consistent containers that run the application identically across environments.
- **Render / Railway**: Cloud platforms to host and manage deployments easily.

Implementing CI/CD will improve development efficiency, reduce bugs, and enable faster delivery of new features.
