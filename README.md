# AirBnB Clone Project

## 📌 Overview

This project is a simplified clone of the AirBnB web application. It aims to reproduce some of the core functionalities of the real platform, such as user listings, bookings, and backend management.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Understand and implement the MVC architecture.
- Build a RESTful API using FastAPI (or Flask).
- Store data using PostgreSQL or SQLite.
- Learn to deploy a full-stack application.
- Apply object-oriented programming and version control (Git).

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python  
- **Framework**: FastAPI or Flask  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / SQLite  
- **Frontend**: (Optional) HTML/CSS/JS  
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub  
- **Deployment**: Render / Railway / Docker

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the backend:

```bash
